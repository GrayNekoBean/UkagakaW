# UkagakaW -- Another Ukagaka Engine

Here is a building project UkagakaW, it integrated a script engine and a desktop renderer. This software was inspired by a concept called "Ukagaka", it is something like a customizable powerful "desktop pet" and it had mature system and community, this thing was popular 10 years ago. However, I was not even an author of a Ukagaka because I found it too late, but I still wish that I could build another Ukagaka community like those in past, at least I want to begin from this project. If you are interested in Ukagaka, you can try to Google "SSP(Sakura Script Loader)" and you may find their community(maybe Japanese or Chinese). 

## An unofficial build of a Modern Ukagaka Engine. 

**This is not a shiori like YAYA, it is kind of another SSP(Sakura Script Player) that more modernize and equip with more functions. we do have our own script system to create an Ukagaka, but we also plan to be compatible with SSP style shiori(s) like YAYA**
